### v3.0.0

[2020.07.20; Maikuolan] First stable release for the phpMussel v3 Front-End.

__*Why "v3.0.0" instead of "v1.0.0?"*__ Prior to phpMussel v3, the "phpMussel Core", "phpMussel CLI-mode", "phpMussel Front-End", and "phpMussel Uploads Handler" ("phpMussel Web") were all bundled together as a single repository (phpMussel/phpMussel). Since phpMussel v3, these each all have their own, separate repositories. I've opted to start releases at this repository (phpMussel/FrontEnd) at *v3.0.0*, in order to avoid confusion with previous versions of the "phpMussel Front-End" which exist outside this repository.

### v3.0.1

[2020.07.31; Maikuolan]: Improved the way that the (generated by ...) notice, displayed at the footer of HTML pages, is rendered.

[2020.08.04; Maikuolan]: Addressed a potential compatibility problem with installations where PHP has its output proxied through to a different host. Also slightly improved the aesthetics of the front-end, and changed the logout link to a logout button.

[2020.10.08; Maikuolan]: Added some 'copy to clipboard' buttons to the homepage and statistics page.

[2021.02.05; Maikuolan]: The preview text next to the input fields on the configuration page didn't quite align properly; Fixed.
