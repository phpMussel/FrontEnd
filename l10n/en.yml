checkbox_delete_orphaned_values: "Delete orphaned values."
config:
 core: "General configuration (any core configuration not belonging to other categories)."
 core_default_timeout: "Default timeout to use for external requests? Default = 12 seconds."
 core_delete_on_sight: "Enabling this directive will instruct the script to attempt to immediately delete any scanned attempted file upload matching any detection criteria, whether via signatures or otherwise. Files determined to be "clean" won't be touched. In the case of archives, the entire archive will be deleted, regardless of whether or not the offending file is only one of several files contained within the archive. For the case of file upload scanning, usually, it isn't necessary to enable this directive, because usually, PHP will automatically purge the contents of its cache when execution has finished, meaning it'll usually delete any files uploaded through it to the server unless they've been moved, copied or deleted already. This directive is added here as an extra measure of security for those whose copies of PHP mightn't always behave in the manner expected. False = After scanning, leave the file alone [Default]; True = After scanning, if not clean, delete immediately."
 core_disabled_channels: "This can be used to prevent phpMussel from using particular channels when sending requests."
 core_error_log: "A file for logging any non-fatal errors detected. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."
 core_hide_version: "Hide version information from logs and page output? True = Yes; False = No [Default]."
 core_ipaddr: "Where to find the IP address of connecting requests? (Useful for services such as Cloudflare and the likes). Default = REMOTE_ADDR. WARNING: Don't change this unless you know what you're doing!"
 core_lang: "Specify the default language for phpMussel."
 core_lang_override: "Localise according to HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE whenever possible? True = Yes [Default]; False = No."
 core_log_rotation_action: "Log rotation limits the number of log files that should exist at any one time. When new log files are created, if the total number of log files exceeds the specified limit, the specified action will be performed. You can specify the desired action here."
 core_log_rotation_limit: "Log rotation limits the number of log files that should exist at any one time. When new log files are created, if the total number of log files exceeds the specified limit, the specified action will be performed. You can specify the desired limit here. A value of 0 will disable log rotation."
 core_maintenance_mode: "Enable maintenance mode? True = Yes; False = No [Default]. Disables everything other than the front-end. Sometimes useful for when updating your CMS, frameworks, etc."
 core_outbound_request_log: "A file for logging the results of any outbound requests. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."
 core_scan_cache_expiry: "For how long should phpMussel cache the results of scanning? Value is the number of seconds to cache the results of scanning for. Default is 21600 seconds (6 hours); A value of 0 will disable caching the results of scanning."
 core_scan_log: "The name of the file to log all scanning results to. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."
 core_scan_log_serialized: "The name of the file to log all scanning results to (using a serialised format). Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."
 core_statistics: "Track phpMussel usage statistics? True = Yes; False = No [Default]."
 core_time_format: "The date/time notation format used by phpMussel. Additional options may be added upon request."
 core_time_offset: "Timezone offset in minutes."
 core_timezone: "This is used to specify the timezone to use (e.g., Africa/Cairo, America/New_York, Asia/Tokyo, Australia/Perth, Europe/Berlin, Pacific/Guam, etc). Specify "SYSTEM" to let PHP handle this for you automatically."
 core_truncate: "Truncate log files when they reach a certain size? Value is the maximum size in B/KB/MB/GB/TB that a log file may grow to before being truncated. The default value of 0KB disables truncation (log files can grow indefinitely). Note: Applies to individual log files! The size of log files is not considered collectively."
 experimental: "Unstable/Experimental!"
 files: "The specifics of how to handle files when scanning."
 files_allow_leading_trailing_dots: "Allow leading and trailing dots in filenames? This can sometimes be used to hide files, or to trick some systems into allowing directory traversal. False = Don't allow [Default]. True = Allow."
 files_archive_file_extensions: "Recognised archive file extensions (format is CSV; should only add or remove when problems occur; unnecessarily removing may cause false positives to appear for archive files, whereas unnecessarily adding will essentially whitelist what you're adding from attack specific detection; modify with caution; also note that this has no effect on what archives can and can't be analysed at content-level). The list, as is at default, lists those formats used most commonly across the majority of systems and CMS, but intentionally isn't necessarily comprehensive."
 files_block_control_characters: "Block any files containing any control characters (other than newlines)? If you're <em><strong>ONLY</strong></em> uploading plain-text, then you can turn this option on to provide some additional protection to your system. However, if you upload anything other than plain-text, turning this on may result in false positives. False = Don't block [Default]; True = Block."
 files_block_encrypted_archives: "Detect and block encrypted archives? Because phpMussel isn't able to scan the contents of encrypted archives, it's possible that archive encryption may be employed by an attacker as a means of attempting to bypass phpMussel, anti-virus scanners and other such protections. Instructing phpMussel to block any archives that it discovers to be encrypted could potentially help reduce any risk associated with these such possibilities. False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 files_block_macros: "Try to block any files containing macros? Some types of documents and spreadsheets may contain executable macros, thus providing a dangerous potential malware vector. False = Don't block [Default]; True = Block."
 files_can_contain_php_file_extensions: "A list of file extensions allowed to contain PHP code, separated by commas. If PHP chameleon attack detection is enabled, files that contain PHP code, which have extensions that aren't on this list, will be detected as PHP chameleon attacks."
 files_chameleon_from_exe: "Search for executable headers in files that are neither executables nor recognised archives and for executables whose headers are incorrect. False = Off; True = On."
 files_chameleon_from_php: "Search for PHP headers in files that are neither PHP files nor recognised archives. False = Off; True = On."
 files_chameleon_to_archive: "Detect incorrect headers in archives and compressed files. Supported: BZ/BZIP2, GZ/GZIP, LZF, RAR, ZIP. False = Off; True = On."
 files_chameleon_to_doc: "Search for office documents whose headers are incorrect (Supported: DOC, DOT, PPS, PPT, XLA, XLS, WIZ). False = Off; True = On."
 files_chameleon_to_img: "Search for images whose headers are incorrect (Supported: BMP, DIB, PNG, GIF, JPEG, JPG, XCF, PSD, PDD, WEBP). False = Off; True = On."
 files_chameleon_to_pdf: "Search for PDF files whose headers are incorrect. False = Off; True = On."
 files_check_archives: "Attempt to check the contents of archives? False = Don't check; True = Check [Default]. Supported: Zip (requires libzip), Tar, Rar (requires the rar extension)."
 files_corrupted_exe: "Corrupted files and parse errors. False = Ignore; True = Block [Default]. Detect and block potentially corrupted PE (Portable Executable) files? Often (but not always), when certain aspects of a PE file are corrupted or can't be parsed correctly, it can be indicative of a viral infection. The processes used by most anti-virus programs to detect viruses in PE files require parsing those files in certain ways, which, if the programmer of a virus is aware of, will specifically try to prevent, in order to allow their virus to remain undetected."
 files_decode_threshold: "Threshold for the length of raw data within which decode commands should be detected (in case there are any noticeable performance issues while scanning). Default = 512KB. Zero or null disables the threshold (removing any such limitation based on filesize)."
 files_filesize_archives: "Carry over filesize blacklisting/whitelisting to the contents of archives? False = No (just greylist everything); True = Yes [Default]."
 files_filesize_limit: "Filesize limit in KB. 65536 = 64MB [Default]; 0 = No limit (always greylisted). Any (positive) numeric value accepted. This can be useful when your PHP configuration limits the amount of memory a process can hold or if your PHP configuration limits filesize of uploads."
 files_filesize_response: "What to do with files that exceed the filesize limit (if one exists). False = Whitelist; True = Blacklist [Default]."
 files_filetype_archives: "Carry over filetype blacklisting/whitelisting to the contents of archives? False = No (just greylist everything) [Default]; True = Yes."
 files_filetype_blacklist: "Blacklist:"
 files_filetype_greylist: "Greylist:"
 files_filetype_whitelist: "Whitelist:"
 files_max_files_in_archives: "Maximum number of files to scan from within archives before aborting the scan. Default = 0 (no maximum)."
 files_max_recursion: "Maximum recursion depth limit for archives. Default = 3."
 files_only_allow_images: "When set to true, any files encountered by the scanner which aren't images will be flagged immediately, without being scanned. This may help reduce the time needed to complete a scan in some cases. Set to false by default."
 files_scannable_threshold: "Threshold to the length of raw data that phpMussel is permitted to read and scan (in case there are any noticeable performance issues while scanning). Default = 32MB. Zero or null value disables the threshold. Generally, this value shouldn't be less than the average filesize of file uploads that you want and expect to receive to your server or website, shouldn't be more than the filesize_limit directive, and shouldn't be more than roughly one fifth of the total allowable memory allocation granted to PHP via the "php.ini" configuration file. This directive exists to try to prevent phpMussel from using up too much memory (that'd prevent it from being able to successfully scan files above a certain filesize)."
 frontend: "Configuration for the front-end."
 frontend_custom_footer: "Inserted as HTML at the very bottom of all front-end pages. This could be useful in case you want to include a legal notice, contact link, business information or similar at all such pages."
 frontend_custom_header: "Inserted as HTML at the very beginning of all front-end pages. This could be useful in case you want to include a website logo, personalised header, scripts, or similar at all such pages."
 frontend_default_algo: "Defines which algorithm to use for all future passwords and sessions."
 frontend_frontend_log: "File for logging front-end login attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."
 frontend_magnification: "Font magnification. Default = 1."
 frontend_max_login_attempts: "Maximum number of front-end login attempts. Default = 5."
 frontend_numbers: "How do you prefer numbers to be displayed? Select the example that looks the most correct to you."
 frontend_theme: "The aesthetic to use for the phpMussel front-end."
 legal: "Configuration for legal requirements."
 legal_privacy_policy: "The address of a relevant privacy policy to be displayed in the footer of any generated pages. Specify a URL, or leave blank to disable."
 legal_pseudonymise_ip_addresses: "Pseudonymise IP addresses when logging? True = Yes [Default]; False = No."
 quarantine: "Configuration for the quarantine."
 quarantine_quarantine_key: "phpMussel is able to quarantine blocked file uploads, if this is something you want it to do. Casual users of phpMussel that simply wish to protect their websites or hosting environment without having any interest in deeply analysing any flagged attempted file uploads should leave this functionality disabled, but any users interested in further analysis of flagged attempted file uploads for malware research or for similar such things should enable this functionality. Quarantining of flagged attempted file uploads can sometimes also assist in debugging false positives, if this is something that frequently occurs for you. To disable quarantine functionality, simply leave the <code>quarantine_key</code> directive empty, or erase the contents of that directive if it isn't already empty. To enable quarantine functionality, enter some value into the directive. The <code>quarantine_key</code> is an important security feature of the quarantine functionality required as a means of preventing the quarantine functionality from being exploited by potential attackers and as a means of preventing any potential execution of data stored within the quarantine. The <code>quarantine_key</code> should be treated in the same manner as your passwords: The longer the better, and guard it tightly. For best effect, use in conjunction with <code>delete_on_sight</code>."
 quarantine_quarantine_max_files: "The maximum number of files that can exist in the quarantine. When new files are added to the quarantine, if this number is exceeded, old files will be deleted until the remainder no longer exceeds this number. Default = 100."
 quarantine_quarantine_max_filesize: "The maximum filesize allowed for files to be quarantined. Files larger than the value specified will NOT be quarantined. This directive is important as a means of making it more difficult for any potential attackers to flood your quarantine with unwanted data potentially causing run-away data usage on your hosting service. Default = 2MB."
 quarantine_quarantine_max_usage: "The maximum memory usage allowed for the quarantine. If the total memory used by the quarantine reaches this value, the oldest quarantined files will be deleted until the total memory used no longer reaches this value. This directive is important as a means of making it more difficult for any potential attackers to flood your quarantine with unwanted data potentially causing run-away data usage on your hosting service. Default = 64MB."
 signatures: "Configuration for signatures, signature files, etc."
 signatures_active: "A list of the active signature files, delimited by commas. Note: Signature files must firstly be installed, before you can activate them. For the test files to work correctly, the signature files must be installed and activated."
 signatures_detect_adware: "Should phpMussel parse signatures for detecting adware? False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 signatures_detect_deface: "Should phpMussel parse signatures for detecting defacements and defacers? False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 signatures_detect_encryption: "Should phpMussel detect and block encrypted files? False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 signatures_detect_joke_hoax: "Should phpMussel parse signatures for detecting joke/hoax malware/viruses? False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 signatures_detect_packer_packed: "Should phpMussel parse signatures for detecting packers and packed data? False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 signatures_detect_pua_pup: "Should phpMussel parse signatures for detecting PUAs/PUPs? False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 signatures_detect_shell: "Should phpMussel parse signatures for detecting shell scripts? False = No; True = Yes [Default]."
 signatures_fail_extensions_silently: "Should phpMussel report when extensions are missing? If <code>fail_extensions_silently</code> is disabled, missing extensions will be reported on scanning, and if <code>fail_extensions_silently</code> is enabled, missing extensions will be ignored, with scanning reporting for those files that there aren't any problems. Disabling this directive may potentially increase your security, but may also lead to an increase of false positives. False = Disabled; True = Enabled [Default]."
 signatures_fail_silently: "Should phpMussel report when signatures files are missing or corrupted? If <code>fail_silently</code> is disabled, missing and corrupted files will be reported on scanning, and if <code>fail_silently</code> is enabled, missing and corrupted files will be ignored, with scanning reporting for those files that there aren't any problems. This should generally be left alone unless you're experiencing crashes or similar problems. False = Disabled; True = Enabled [Default]."
 signatures_heuristic_threshold: "Some phpMussel signatures are intended to identify suspicious and potentially malicious indicators in files, without in themselves identifying those files as being malicious directly. This "threshold" value tells phpMussel the maximum weight allowed before flagging those files as malicious. The definition of weight in this context is the total number of suspicious and potentially malicious indicators identified. By default, this value will be set to 3. A lower value generally will result in a higher occurrence of false positives but a higher number of malicious files being flagged, whereas a higher value generally will result in a lower occurrence of false positives but a lower number of malicious files being flagged. It's generally best to leave this value at its default unless you're experiencing problems related to it."
 supplementary_cache_options: "Supplementary cache options. Note: Changing these values may potentially log you out."
 supplementary_cache_options_enable_apcu: "Specifies whether to try using APCu for caching. Default = True."
 supplementary_cache_options_enable_memcached: "Specifies whether to try using Memcached for caching. Default = False."
 supplementary_cache_options_enable_pdo: "Specifies whether to try using PDO for caching. Default = False."
 supplementary_cache_options_enable_redis: "Specifies whether to try using Redis for caching. Default = False."
 supplementary_cache_options_memcached_host: "Memcached host value. Default = "localhost"."
 supplementary_cache_options_memcached_port: "Memcached port value. Default = "11211"."
 supplementary_cache_options_pdo_dsn: "PDO DSN value. Default = "mysql:dbname=phpmussel;host=localhost;port=3306"."
 supplementary_cache_options_pdo_password: "PDO password."
 supplementary_cache_options_pdo_username: "PDO username."
 supplementary_cache_options_prefix: "The value specified here will be prepended to all cache entry keys. Default = "phpMussel_". When multiple installations exist at the same server, this can be useful for keeping their caches separate from each other."
 supplementary_cache_options_redis_host: "Redis host value. Default = "localhost"."
 supplementary_cache_options_redis_port: "Redis port value. Default = "6379"."
 supplementary_cache_options_redis_timeout: "Redis timeout value. Default = "2.5"."
 urlscanner: "Configuration for the URL scanner."
 urlscanner_cache_time: "How long (in seconds) should the results of API lookups be cached for? Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour)."
 urlscanner_google_api_key: "Enables API lookups to the Google Safe Browsing API when the necessary API key is defined."
 urlscanner_maximum_api_lookups: "Maximum allowable number of API lookups to perform per individual scan iteration. Because each additional API lookup will add to the total time required to complete each scan iteration, you may wish to stipulate a limitation in order to expedite the overall scan process. When set to 0, no such maximum allowable number will be applied. Set to 10 by default."
 urlscanner_maximum_api_lookups_response: "What to do if the maximum allowable number of API lookups is exceeded? False = Do nothing (continue processing) [Default]; True = Flag/block the file."
 virustotal: "Configuration for Virus Total integration."
 virustotal_vt_public_api_key: "Optionally, phpMussel is able to scan files using the Virus Total API as a way to provide a greatly enhanced level of protection against viruses, trojans, malware and other threats. By default, scanning files using the Virus Total API is disabled. To enable it, an API key from Virus Total is required. Due to the significant benefit that this could provide to you, it's something that I highly recommend enabling. Please be aware, however, that to use the Virus Total API, you <em><strong>MUST</strong></em> agree to their Terms of Service and you <em><strong>MUST</strong></em> adhere to all guidelines as per described by the Virus Total documentation! You are NOT permitted to use this integration feature UNLESS: You have read and agree to the Terms of Service of Virus Total and its API. You have read and you understand, at a minimum, the preamble of the Virus Total Public API documentation (everything after "VirusTotal Public API v2.0" but before "Contents")."
 virustotal_vt_quota_rate: "According to the Virus Total API documentation, "it is limited to at most 4 requests of any nature in any given 1 minute time frame. If you run a honeyclient, honeypot or any other automation that is going to provide resources to VirusTotal and not only retrieve reports you are entitled to a higher request rate quota". By default, phpMussel will strictly adhere to these limitations, but due to the possibility of these rate quotas being increased, these two directives are provided as a means for you to instruct phpMussel as to what limit it should adhere to. Unless you've been instructed to do so, it's not recommended for you to increase these values, but, if you've encountered problems relating to reaching your rate quota, decreasing these values <em><strong>MAY</strong></em> sometimes help you in dealing with these problems. Your rate limit is determined as <code>vt_quota_rate</code> requests of any nature in any given <code>vt_quota_time</code> minute time frame."
 virustotal_vt_quota_time: "(See description above)."
 virustotal_vt_suspicion_level: "By default, phpMussel will restrict which files it scans using the Virus Total API to those files that it considers "suspicious". You can optionally adjust this restriction by changing the value of the <code>vt_suspicion_level</code> directive."
 virustotal_vt_weighting: "Should phpMussel apply the results of scanning using the Virus Total API as detections or as detection weighting? This directive exists, because, although scanning a file using multiple engines (as Virus Total does) should result in an increased detection rate (and therefore in a higher number of malicious files being caught), it can also result in a higher number of false positives, and therefore, in some circumstances, it may be better to use the results of the scan as a confidence score rather than as a definitive conclusion. If a value of 0 is used, the results of scanning using the Virus Total API will be applied as detections, and therefore, if any engine used by Virus Total flags the file being scanned as being malicious, phpMussel will consider the file to be malicious. If any other value is used, the results of scanning using the Virus Total API will be applied as detection weighting, and therefore, the number of engines used by Virus Total that flag the file being scanned as being malicious will serve as a confidence score (or detection weighting) for whether or not the file being scanned should be considered malicious by phpMussel (the value used will represent the minimum confidence score or weight required in order to be considered malicious). A value of 0 is used by default."

 vt_suspicion_level_heuristic_only: "Scan only files with heuristic weight.\nFiles will be scanned only if they incur some heuristic weight. Heuristic weight can be incurred from signatures intended to catch common fingerprints associated with potential infection which don't necessarily guarantee infection. The lookup, in such cases, can serve to provide a second opinion for results which justify suspicion but don't otherwise provide any certainty."
hints_pdo_dsn:
 FAQ.: "<em><a href="https://github.com/phpMussel/Docs/blob/master/readme.en.md\#user-content-HOW_TO_USE_PDO" hreflang="en-AU">What is a "PDO DSN"? How can I use PDO with phpMussel?</a></em>"
hints_xlists:
 How this works.: "If your system allows only specific types of files to be uploaded, or if your system explicitly denies certain types of files, specifying those filetypes in whitelists, blacklists, and greylists can increase the speed at which scanning is performed by allowing the script to skip over certain filetypes. Format is CSV (comma separated values)."
 Logical order of processing.: "If the filetype is whitelisted, don't scan and don't block the file, and don't check the file against the blacklist or the greylist. If the filetype is blacklisted, don't scan the file but block it anyway, and don't check the file against the greylist. If the greylist is empty or if the greylist is not empty and the filetype is greylisted, scan the file as per normal and determine whether to block it based on the results of the scan, but if the greylist is not empty and the filetype is not greylisted, treat the file as blacklisted, therefore not scanning it but blocking it anyway."
