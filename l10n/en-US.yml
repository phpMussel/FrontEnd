config_core_lang_override: "Localize according to HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE whenever possible? True = Yes [Default]; False = No."
config_core_scan_log_serialized: "Filename of file to log all scanning results to (using a serialized format). Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."
config_files_archive_file_extensions: "Recognized archive file extensions (format is CSV; should only add or remove when problems occur; unnecessarily removing may cause false positives to appear for archive files, whereas unnecessarily adding will essentially whitelist what you're adding from attack specific detection; modify with caution; also note that this has no effect on what archives can and can't be analysed at content-level). The list, as is at default, lists those formats used most commonly across the majority of systems and CMS, but intentionally isn't necessarily comprehensive."
config_files_chameleon_from_exe: "Search for executable headers in files that are neither executables nor recognized archives and for executables whose headers are incorrect. False = Off; True = On."
config_files_chameleon_from_php: "Search for PHP headers in files that are neither PHP files nor recognized archives. False = Off; True = On."
config_frontend_custom_header: "Inserted as HTML at the very beginning of all front-end pages. This could be useful in case you want to include a website logo, personalized header, scripts, or similar at all such pages."
config_legal_pseudonymise_ip_addresses: "Pseudonymize IP addresses when logging? True = Yes [Default]; False = No."
